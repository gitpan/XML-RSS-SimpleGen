NAME
    XML::RSS::SimpleGen -- for writing RSS files


SYNOPSIS

      # A complete example screen-scraper and RSS generator here:
  
      use strict;
      use XML::RSS::SimpleGen;
      my $url = q<http://www.exile.ru/>;
  
      rss_new( $url, "eXile", "Moscow-based Alternative Newspaper" );
      rss_language( 'en' );
      rss_webmaster( 'xxxxx@yourdomain.com' );
      rss_twice_daily();
  
      get_url( $url );
  
      while(
       m{<h4>\s*<a href='/(.*?)'.*?>(.*?)</a>\s*</h4>\s*<p.*?>(.*?)<a href='/}sg
      ) {
        rss_item("$url$1", $2, $3);
      }
  
      die "No items in this content?! {{\n$_\n}}\nAborting"
       unless rss_item_count();
  
      rss_save( 'exile.rss', 45 );
      exit;


DESCRIPTION
    This module is for writing RSS files, simply. It transparently handles
    all the unpleasant details of RSS, like proper XML escaping, and also
    has a good number of Do-What-I-Mean features, like not changing the
    modtime on a written-out RSS file if the file content hasn't changed,
    and like automatically removing any HTML tags from content you might
    pass in.

    This module isn't meant to have the full expressive power of RSS;
    instead, it provides functions that are most commonly needed by
    RSS-writing programs.

PREREQUISITES

This suite requires perl 5.004 or higher.


INSTALLATION

You install XML::RSS::SimpleGen et al, as you would install any Perl module
library, by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you want to install a private copy of XML::RSS::SimpleGen in your home
directory, then you should try to produce the initial Makefile with
something like this command:

  perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/perl

See perldoc perlmodinstall for more information and advice.



DOCUMENTATION

POD-format documentation is included in XML/RSS/SimpleGen.pm.  POD is
readable with the 'perldoc' utility, like with "perldoc XML::RSS::SimpleGen"

See ChangeLog for recent changes.


MACPERL INSTALLATION NOTES

Don't bother with the makefiles.  Just make an RSS directory under
your XML directory under your MacPerl site_lib or lib directory, and
move SimpleGen.pm into it (the RSS directory, that is).
