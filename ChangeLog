                                        Time-stamp: "2004-02-06 21:20:30 AST"

2004-02-06  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	* Release 11.11
	
	* Added some DWIM logic so that when you feed items to a feed that
	you've declared a history file for, but where that history file
	doesn't exist on disc yet (or exists but is 0-length), then items
	you feed it get their date-stamps fiddled with so that the first
	things you feed it look like the most recent, and so are the first
	things to appear in the output RSS file.

	This doesn't affect feeds with no history files, nor does it
	affect feeds that already have contentful history files.  It just
	makes things work nicer when setting up new feeds with history
	files.
	
2004-01-31  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpna.org
	* Release 11.10
	* Previous version failed to correct decimal-entities for Win-lame
	characters.  (E.g., "&#146;" wasn't getting corrected to
	"&#8217;", atho its hex version, "&#x93;", was.)
	Fixed.
	And added tests to 10_html2xmltext.t for this.

	* Release 11.09
	* Previous version generated incorrect ttl figures for rss_daily,
	rss_twice_daily, rss_thrice_daily, and rss_weekly.  Fixed.

2004-01-17  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	* Release 11.08
	* After many many development versions, this is the first
	public release.
